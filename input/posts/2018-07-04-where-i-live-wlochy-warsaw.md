**Name**: Thanasis

**Nationality**: Cypriot

**City:** Warsaw

**Distict:** Stary WÅ‚ochy

**Accommodation Type:** Bought apartment in 2017 ,Ground floor with garden

**What attracted you to, and keeps you in, the district?**

It's like leaving Warsaw. Low density housing and lots of greenery are particularly special. Despite being 10km from the centre, the area is well developed and maintained and there are excellent transport links.

We feel lucky living here as we are close to anything we need and my sons school is just a 10-minute drive away, once you leave around 7 a.m.!

Shoppingwise, we are close enough to Popularna and we have Tesco, Pharmacies, Gastorama, Papugarnia and 2 parks nearby( one park being the best in Warsaw).

Dom Kulture is also on our corner. There is a Zabka and a 24/7 store within walking distance. and we are also close to Blue City.

To me and my family the entire area allows us to relax as children can play in a safe environment.

**Any negatives?**

Traffic !

**What are you doing here?**

I am an IT support specialist and automation developer for a very good company here in Warsaw. Additionally, I write blogs for <https://tourspoland.com/blog>

**What's your best tip for people looking to buy /rent/get a home loan?**

BigDoor24.pl looks like a good idea.
