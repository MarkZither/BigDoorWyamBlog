Are you paying too much rent or to little? ... or, as Goldilocks would say, just right!

A few comments first on our data.

We have researched all offers advertised for each district across a number of portals, adjusting for stupid offers (rent for zl. 1 etc. !). Additionally we have only concentrated on those areas where there a  number of properties offered, omitting districts where we felt the number of offers were too low to confidently derive an average.

We would also add that these are offers (net of media) and so are open to negotiation. It would be fair to say that in a lot of cases the average could be reduced by 5 % + if we had access to actual market rents.

We start by looking at the average Rent per district in real terms.

As you can see by the Graph below, rents in the city range from under zl. 2,300 to nearly zl. 3,100 depending on where you decide to live. With the city average at 2,650, most districts are actually very close to this.

Within the numbers, there is a disparity between apartments that have been newly built and those that are in older buildings. Newly built apartments do tend to be both more expensive in rent but also in terms of building management costs.

To get a better view on value, the following graph is average rent per metre squared ( m2).

At first look, we can see that Zabianka-Jelitkowo is more expensive in real terms , you will actually get a slightly larger apartment for your money compared to Srodmiescie.

**Availability**

The availability is similar to other cities with approximately 4 times more apartments for sale versus those available to rent. However, the number of properties for sale or rent is significantly lower than for example Krakow, versus population.
