**LODZ**

So you're either moving to Lodz or just looking for a new place in the city and need a some tips.  For information on the city and its history you can see the wikipedia page [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA). 

At BigDoor24.pl we were interested less in the history and more in some of the average rental costs , availability levels etc in the main districts.

Generally in the city, as of September 2018, average monthly rents were PLN 2,065 + utilities ( media ) which equates to PLN 37.50 per square metre, on average.

Based on our research there are currently just over 600 apartments available for rent, of differing quality and sizes, which is slightly less than the national average based on population.

We would point out that these numbers are based on what is on offer rather than a study of all rental prices etc.. Additionally the figures may be skewed upwards slightly as it includes expensive penthouses.

To give an even clearer picture we have broken down our numbers by district below.
