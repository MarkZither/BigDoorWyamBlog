The official numbers are out from the [National Map of Security Risks](https://policja.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=b5fc08aaa8a54296b418383584313263) detailing amongst others, the number of reported burglaries by Vovoidship for the period January to June 2019.

Keep in mind, when [compared to all EU countries](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/d/d9/Burglary_of_private_residential_premises%2C_2016_%28police-recorded_offences_per_100_000_inhabitants%29.png), Poland is very much at the very low  end of the scale.
