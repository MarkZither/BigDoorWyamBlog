When deciding where to buy (or indeed if to sell) a property there are many ways to indicate where prices are heading and indeed the best city to find value in. For this article, we are going to look at salaries vs. price.  Whilst we would never suggest you look at only one statistic when deciding where to invest we believe it is a good starting point when looking for value in the Polish property market.

First a couple of basic facts. Currently a Polish mortgage will cost you zl. 400 per zl. 100,000 borrowed ( approx.) and the Banks don't want you borrowing more than you can afford to repay each month. This therefore puts a ceiling on how much you can borrow depending on your salary.

CW Wealth Management recently reported in [CEO World Magazine](https://ceoworld.biz/2019/07/29/where-polands-richest-live-the-top-10-wealthiest-cities/) a list of earnings per head of population for the main Polish cities. They have reported these numbers in USD and don't stipulate whether they are gross or net of taxes - We would think gross. Additionally, they do not explain their methodology however we shall assume that if there are mistakes they are consistent. We will use the USD/PLN rate of 3.85. For property prices we have used the average price of 1 square meter as per the top three property portals in each city.
