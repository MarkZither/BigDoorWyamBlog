The Irish call it Paddy's Day, the Americans, Saint Patty's Day, and the Poles, Festiwal sw. Patryka but the celebration by Irish communities around the world for St. Patrick's Day is only getting bigger.

In recognition of it's popularity (and at the insistence of the Irish members of Team BigDoor24) we are moving away from our regular updates and articles on Polish property and mortgage information to list just some of the events for the coming weekend.

Additionally, in tune with Global celebrations of not so much being Irish as just " having the craic" ( having fun) , various prominent Polish landmarks will be lit up in green. Apologies to those involved in the many other events we have not included but there is just too much going on ! 

**Warsaw**

**Mar. 16th** -  A Ball will be held on in aid of various Polish charities, guaranteed to be fun, with the warm fuzzy feeling of helping the needy thrown into the bargain.

**Mar. 17th** - Fell the Reel is an evening of Irish Dancing and Music
