The Irish call it Paddy's Day, the Americans, Saint Patty's Day, and the Poles, Festiwal sw. Patryka as the celebrations by Irish communities around the world for St. Patrick's Day only gets bigger.

In recognition of it's popularity (and at the insistence of the Irish members of Team BigDoor24) we are moving away from our regular updates and articles on Polish property and mortgage information to list just some of the events for the coming weekend.

Additionally, in tune with Global celebrations of not so much being Irish as just " having the craic" ( having fun) , keep an eye out in your City for the various prominent Polish landmarks that will be lit up in Irish Green.

Apologies to those involved in the many other events we have not included but there is just too much going on !
