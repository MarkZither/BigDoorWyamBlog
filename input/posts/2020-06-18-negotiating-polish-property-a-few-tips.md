As the market emerges from lockdown it is still too early to call the general direction of the Polish property market but some early signs suggest that the price negotiations may become more common.

At the time of writing, rental prices have been aggressively marked down as the AirBnB apartments look for regular tenants and Developers are seen offering small discounts of 2 to 3 %.

**The Players & Their Motivation**

Seller/Landlord - get the best price, reflective of their time frame to close.

Buyer/Renter - get the best price.

Seller/Letting Broker - Get it done fast, at the best price ( in that order).

Buyer/Renter Agent - Get it done fast, within the budget of the client.

Buying

Know your budget and be realistic. What type of buyer are you? Do you need a mortgage or to sell your existing home? Are you in a hurry? The speed at which you can close will determine how much you end up paying so control what you can before you begin negotiating, or even property searching. It costs nothing to complete a mortgage application to confirm your budget so do it early.

Know your market

You don't have to do a lot of research to get more information on your intended location. Simply visit the location and check similar properties on property sites. In particular, take note of the published number of viewers on the advert of the property you are interested in.
