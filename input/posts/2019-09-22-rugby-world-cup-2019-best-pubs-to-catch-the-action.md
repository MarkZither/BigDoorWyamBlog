As the Rugby world Cup begins in Tokyo this week we thought we would list some of our favourite places to watch the (very) early morning games. We understand (and happy to be corrected) that it is not available on terrestrial Polish T.V. so these spots may be your best bet for both the game and some atmosphere.



Krakow - [Duffys Irish Bar](https://www.facebook.com/DUFFYSIRISHBAR/) - As one of the best Irish Pubs in the country they are open for all the games.



Gdansk - [Pub Piwnica](https://www.facebook.com/pg/Irish-Pub-Piwnica-500146810031489/posts/?ref=page_internal) - Not showing the earliest of games (Ireland v Scotland 9.45 a.m. for example) but worth checking out their timetable.
