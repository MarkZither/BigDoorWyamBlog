At BigDoor24 we are all about property, much like Rugby ....gaining ground or losing it we can see the parallels.

As the Rugby World Cup begins in Tokyo this week we thought we would list some possible places to watch the (very) early morning games. We understand that it is not available on terrestrial Polish T.V. so these spots may be your best bet for both the game and some atmosphere.

**Krakow** - [Duffys Irish Bar](https://www.facebook.com/DUFFYSIRISHBAR/) - As one of the best Irish Pubs in the country they are open for all the games.

**Gdansk** - [Pub Piwnica](https://www.facebook.com/pg/Irish-Pub-Piwnica-500146810031489/posts/?ref=page_internal) - Not showing the earliest of games (Ireland v Scotland 9.45 a.m. today for example) but worth checking out their timetable.

**Poznan** - [Tanners Irish Pub](https://www.facebook.com/tannersirishpub/) - They are opening at 9 a.m. so you may not get the early early games but still plenty to see and enjoy with your fellow fans.

**Warsaw** - We are going to go with [Champions](https://www.champions.pl/) here as all Irish or British Pubs we checked didn't even seem to know that the rugby was on! .. Happy to be corrected and make changes.

**Lodz** - You could try [The Football Pub](https://www.facebook.com/FootballPubLodz/?rf=201997076485688) but they don't mention if they are open early for the games.

**Wroclaw** - Look in at  [Winners](http://thewinnerspub.pl/) which opens at 12.00 p.m. so at least you can catch the last games of the day.

Our research made pretty clear that there is not a lot of places making any serious effort to show the games. If you know for a fact there is a rugby friendly bar out there please let us know and we will add it to the list.

Have a Great 'Rucking Tournament
