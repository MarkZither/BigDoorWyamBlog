Cinemas , petrol stations and shops operated by owners will still be allowed to open.

If you are disappointed by this reduction from 2018 levels, be consoled by the knowledge that in 2020 there will only be 7 days of Sunday shopping available.

Every Sunday, The Digest, our weekly round up of Polish news, will include details on shop openings so follow us now.
