**They are not all the same...**

In a country as large as Poland there are obviously a number of different property portals . Understanding how they operate and indeed, who advertises on them will help you find the very best property to buy or rent. 

We begin this series with Renting, apartments & houses on a national basis. In later articles we will cover buying/selling and also look at the best in terms of your city

Let's start with the numbers. The charts below detail the number of offers on one day, with the portion of offers provided by Private owners (non-agency) for apartments and houses.

[**OLX**](https://www.olx.pl/)

Multi Lingual - No

Blog Articles - No

_User experience_ – well laid out but may be confusing using google translate to identify the filter options.The search filter is average and the map functionality is very basic. There are no comparison tools but the KM radius search could be handy. 

**Score 3/5**

[**Gumtree**](https://www.gumtree.pl/)

Multi Lingual - No

Blog Articles - No

_User experience_ – Jumpy search filters in line with it's basic, "do all" layout . Again, limited but effective map functionality with no comparative pricing

**Score 3/5
**

[**Morizon**](https://www.morizon.pl/)

Multi Lingual - No

Blog Articles - Yes

_User experience _– By far the best designed site of the pack. Very well laid out and easy yet detailed filter options. Once a property is chosen the resulting page also shows similar offers to the side and helpful blog articles below. The main advantage is the map display of all offers, allowing users to see local amenities in addition to available properties.

**Score 4.5/5**

[**BigDoor24.pl sends you a zl. 250 retail voucher of your choice for every successful Polish Mortgage Applicant referred - (in addition to what we pay them) - register now for your personal referral code.**](https://bigdoor24.pl/)

[**Otodom**](https://www.otodom.pl/)

Multi Lingual - No

Blog Articles - Yes

_User experience_ – Very high standard as a dedicated property portal. With excellent map functionality it also includes trend graphs and comparative pricing guides. There are a bit too many irrelevant ads displayed but good content in the blog articles.

**Score 4/5
**

[**Nieruchomosci Online**](https://www.nieruchomosci-online.pl/)

Multi Lingual - No

Blog Articles - Yes

_User experience_ – Very well laid out and simple with less text and more icons providing a concise property description. Lots of good articles too but no comparative pricing or multi property maps.

**Score 3.5/5
**

[**Gratka**](https://gratka.pl/)

Multi Lingual - No

Blog Articles - Yes

_User experience_ - Once the main property portal, now it's just a sad shadow of it's competition. We could list the stupid pathway and things it doesn't do but why bother. Just bad.

**Score 1/5

Notable mention -[ **Facebook
**](https://www.facebook.com/bigdoor24/)

There are plenty of groups on Facebook where you can find agency and private offers. There is a feeling that these offers tend to be more expensive than the market as they target expats who are assumed to have higher budgets but we can't substantiate this. It's a good resource but don't ignore the portals.

**Which to choose?**

Each has different strengths and weaknesses and it really depends on what you are looking for. A private apartment offer? OLX looks best, A house? Morizon has more offers. Probably best to mix and match and take advantage of the different tools they offer.

There is no indication of the language skills of the advertisers so be prepared to be disappointed if you don't receive any response to your queries, ( or just use us, [BigDoor24.pl- Just Easier](https://bigdoor24.pl/))
