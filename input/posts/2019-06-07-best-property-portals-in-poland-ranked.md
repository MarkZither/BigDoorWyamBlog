Top property search sites in Poland



In a country as large as Poland there are obviously a number of different property portals . Understanding how they operate and indeed, who advertises on them will help you find the very best property to buy or rent. 



Advertising fees and geeography all play a part in where properties are shown so it may be worth checking out more than one portal depending on your requirements.



We wil start this series with renting only and using national statistics. In later articles we will cover buying and also look at the best in terms of your city. - Like us now on facebook to avoid missing out.

House			3815			n/a

Multi Lingual		No

Blog Articles		Yes



Once the main property portal, now it's just a sad shadow of it's competition. We could list the stupid pathway and things it doesn't do but why bother. Just bad. Score 1/5



Facebook



There are plenty of groups on Facebook where you can find agency and non agency offers. There is a feeling that these offers tend to be more expensive than the market as they target expats who are assumed to have higher budgets but we can't substatiate this. It's a good resource but don't ignore the portals.



So which to choose?



Each has different strengths and weaknesses and it really depends on what you are looking for. There is no indication of the language skills of the advertisers so be prepared to be disappointed if you don't receive any response to your queries.
