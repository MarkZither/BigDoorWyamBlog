Everyone is doing it so why can't I?

If you are considering investing in Polish property and renting out with Airbnb, the first issue is location. With the advent of remote check-in, buying where you live is no longer a restraint and optimal returns should drive your decision

Before you rush off to Bydgoszcz, there are of course other factors that should influence your decision i.e. local management facilities, future property price growth, tourism numbers etc.

Additionally it's hard to argue against Warsaw and Krakow being magnets for visitors to Poland but as our research shows, the obvious is not always the best.

And don't forget, with bigdoor24.pl you not only get automatic discounts in agency fees but also cash back on homeloans.
