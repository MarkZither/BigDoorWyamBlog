**What attracted you to, and keeps you in, the district?**

Everything you need in one place. From restaurants, through shops to public transportation which allows to travel smoothly around Tricity.

5 minutes from the beach works perfect as well ;)

**Any negatives?**

As it is in the city centre, it gets a bit noisy and crowded from time to time. The pluses are far more important though.

**What are you doing here?**

Living, working, relaxing, love the area in every aspect of life. I'm close to work, close to my friends, close to my favourite spots. Gotta love the centre of the city :)

**What's your best tip for people looking to buy/rent/get a mortgage?**

Lots of research and go to a Credit Advisor early in the process.
