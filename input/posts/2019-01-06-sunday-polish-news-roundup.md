Just one story this week. Five teenage girls are dead after a fire in an escape room party event.  With over 1,000 escape rooms operating in Poland, recriminations and regulations will surely follow but for now we believe no other news should crowd out this horrifying event.

More details on the story can be found [here](https://www.tvn24.pl/tvn24-news-in-english,157,m/tragic-fire-in-an-escape-room-in-koszalin-leaves-5-girls-dead,897506.html). ( TVN - Video)

We will return next week with a full roundup and for those interested in new 2019 Sunday trading dates you can see details [here](https://bigdoor24.pl/blog/posts/2018-12-18-kiss-goodbye.html).
