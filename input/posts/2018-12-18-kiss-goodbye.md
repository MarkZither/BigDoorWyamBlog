A lot of you knew it was coming but may have forgotten.

After the introduction of the 2018 Sunday trading ban, limiting shopping to just two Sundays a month, the next stage will begin in January 2019 reducing opening days by almost a half.

In 2019, large stores will be open on the following dates

Jan 27  / Feb 24 / Mar 31 / Apr 14 & 28 / May 26 / Jun 30 / Jul 28

Aug 25 / Sep 29 / Oct 27 /  Nov 24 / Dec 15, 22 & 29

Cinemas , petrol stations and shops operated by owners will still be allowed to operate.

If you are disappointed by this reduction from 2018 levels, be consoled by the knowledge that in 2020 there will only be 7 days of Sunday shopping available!

**Every Sunday, The Digest, our roundup of Polish News, will include details of shop openings so you are always in the know. Follow us now to ensure you don't miss it.**
