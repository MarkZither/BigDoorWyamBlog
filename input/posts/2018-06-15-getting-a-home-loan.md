You are looking to buy a property but will require a homeloan. Well, before you even start looking the first thing you should do is to find out how much you can borrow. Seems obvious but lots of people leave this too late and find themselves rushing with applications at the last moment.

It can all be a little chicken and egg as the bank will not confirm how much until they know about the property and of course you don't know which property until you know how much you can borrow.

Obviously, signing a preliminary agreement with the seller and paying the non-refundable 10 % deposit can be daunting without an actual guarantee from the bank so do what you cn now to avoid this predicament.

It's a long time ago that relationships between a bank and their customer had any importance and these days it is a simple numbers game so applying to every bank would seem to make more sense. But did you know that this can currently hurt your chances of  success?

At present, the rating agency used by all banks will reduce your credit rating if you are seen to apply to more than three banks, Daft I know, but there you go .

This makes it even more important that you employ the services of a qualified independent Credit Advisor.  They earn commission from the bank so there is no charge to you for their work. A good Advisor should be able to assess your situation quickly and give you good guidance on how much you can expect to borrow. Additionally they will also be aware of which banks would be more interested in lending to you, thus increasing your chances of success.
