			<title>Polish Property in 2020 - Some Thoughts &amp; Observations</title>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As we enter month two of our &amp;quot;please give me your Netflix password&amp;quot; period, there is no shortage of people who can tell you what will happen in the future. Whilst there is nothing wrong with listening to educated experts suggesting possible outcomes, declarative economic statements should be eyed with suspicion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our reasoning is simple, we just don't have all of the information needed to make any kind of projection of the future in general or Polish property in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we write, global stock markets are suggesting a quick recovery whilst the bond markets are suggesting a recession. Go figure!. We don't know when this will end, which one would assume is kind of important in making a forecast. Consequently, there will be no definitive statements from our side on Polish property until there is more data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are some things we think may be worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent article, before Corona kicked off, we wrote about the latest data regarding &lt;a href="https://blog.bigdoor24.pl/posts/2020-02-10-poland-city-rent-vs-mortgage-costs-which-is-best-and-where.html"&gt;Rent v. Mortgage Costs by City&lt;/a&gt;. In it, we looked at three different sized apartments and the outcome was that, if you were an investor, you bought two smaller apartments rather than one big one as the rental on the larger properties rarely covered the mortgage costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think in the future this will change........dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing the size of a property to rent or buy is normally decided firstly by affordability and then by requirement. Our requirements have changed and we believe this will be reflected far in to the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of when we are all released back into the world, the idea of remote working will be a reality for many. For those with children, this will always mean an extra room (with a big lock). As working from home becomes more prevalent, we can see increased demand for houses in the suburbs of our cities, with gardens. We can see the design of apartments change fundamentally as &amp;quot;work pods&amp;quot; may be included in addition to standard rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our online shopping habits have also changed with those previously reluctant participants now all becoming tech whizzes, surfing vast virtual shopping malls with ease. So why have a Galeria? Or let's go further, why have a city centre, as we understand them today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of any economic stimulus introduced in the future to repair damaged economies will include infrastructure development. And our new realities will require new thinking and new planning. New city planning will also affect where new properties appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also believe that Banks will entirely change their valuation models and risk assessments of new mortgages. How that will impact? Well, as we said, we need more data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So rather than asking if Polish property will fall in value, (it will), or if it will return to pre-corona levels (it will but who knows when), consider the type of property you want to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider, after this global shock that we will recover from eventually, what the renter or buyer of tomorrow will be interested in, knowing that they may need a new netflix password at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay Safe, Stay In and Stay Thoughtful.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Amongst the many disruptions to the global economy, many companies have suddenly rose in value as their product directly benefits the current situation. Airbnb is not one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent article from &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/airbnb-halts-hiring-marketing-report-2020-3?IR=T"&gt;Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;, they report that not only has Airbnb halted all new hires but it has actually stopped all advertising in a bid to survive through the current crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does this mean for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have mentioned in previous articles, using Airbnb as a benchmark for investment returns is never the best idea. With the prospect of local and national regulations coming into force, limiting the profile of the Airbnb host, we always advised that a canny investor should work off the normal long term rental return when making decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are an Airbnb host, then things are undoubtedly tough for you at the moment and we would strongly advise you take advantage of the Polish Mortgage holiday offers currently available. There is more on this subject &lt;a href="https://blog.bigdoor24.pl/posts/2020-03-20-polish-mortgage-should-you-suspend-repayments-during-corona-chaos.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airbnb's strength in the market is down to it's name recognition and massive marketing budget but the concept of renting a room directly from the owner is still not a bad one. When this pandemic is over, Airbnb will be open or closed based on it's cash balance rather than any particular long term problem with it's business model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Airbnb launched about 10 years ago, there have been may copycats and whilst none of them have the heft of the Airbnb brand, Booking.com certainly seems to have taken a large part of the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Airbnb does fail, then rest assured there will be replacements. When the smoke settles we will be here to review the contenders, their strengths and weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's stay in touch,&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Corona Chaos - Buying PLN in a Casino Environment</title>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This article will probably be out of date between the time you begin reading it and when you get to the end. That is how erratic and unpredictable these markets have become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Question&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many, like you, who are wondering if it is wise to buy PLN now at 4.60 levels against the Euro and 4.20 against the US Dollar. Should you wait for better prices? If you wait, will you miss out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it happens, one member of our BigDoor24  Team was a market Trader for many years so we thought we would share some tips that may help you in your decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We begin by looking at the history of the currency. The best chart we could find was from the excellent &lt;a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/EURPLN/"&gt;Oanda/TradingView&lt;/a&gt; site. Please open this chart in another tab as we discuss our findings. We are only discussing Eur/PLN for the purposes of this article as the same logic can apply to other currencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have gone back as far as 2003 on the chart and we can see that the level in February 2004 was 4.88. This can be viewed as the highest price achieved in the last 17 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we don't like this rate as an historic high as it was reflective of Poland's entry to the EU and it's developing economy from the big bang of the early 90's. We much prefer the rate of 4.63 in February 2009. The world was entering one of the worst recessions in decades and the Polish Zloty was treated as much more of a minor currency than it is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this, the Eur/PLN is now pretty much at the same level as it was during the worst of the global recession of 2008 +.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Answer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this fair value? If you think not, then fill your boots and buy as much as you can. If you think EuroLand or the U.S. will do better than Poland than current media suggests, then hold off and wait. We believe anything over 4.60 is unknown territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final point - calculate the amount you want to exchange and it if its a small cash difference relative to the rate change... stop trying to guess and just change your money when you need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the pandemic grows and eventually shrinks, we will try to keep you informed of the financial issues you need to know about. Let's keep in touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay safe,&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Polish Mortgage? Should you Suspend Repayments during Corona Chaos?</title>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;If you have an existing Polish Mortgage you are probably aware that one of the many financial reactions to the current coronavirus pandemic is a possibility to suspend your monthly mortgage repayments for up to three months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As at the time of writing, not all Banks have announced their procedures or parameters for qualifying or availing of the payment holiday so we will just look at the option generally. We will also look at issues you need to consider when deciding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should you take a Polish Mortgage repayment holiday?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a stand alone question, the answer is a resounding yes. This is one of the easier things the Banks and Government can do to alleviate suffering in the economy as they will just extend your repayment period. This means that in 20/30 years you will have an extra three months to pay than you do now. The reducing value of money means that your repayment of zl. 100 in 20 years time will be a lot lower as a percentage of your salary then as compared to now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to this, the future still remains very uncertain. Will you have a job at the end of this? Will you have the same salary? Even if you are not concerned now about your financial future, it's never a bad idea to have as much cash saved as you can.  We would view a payment holiday as a way of having a buffer for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things to watch out for -&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contracts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks have said that they will not charge fees for any of these changes and will make the process simple. Take the time to read the new contracts as it is not beyond the Banks to make changes to benefit themselves. Make sure you are happy with any changes they make to your terms. After the last recession, many Banks worldwide played fast and loose with contract changes regarding fixed rates etc.. In some cases, the Bank may not offer to extend the loan period but instead add the suspended amounts to future monthly repayments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Credit Rating&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amongst other things, your mortgage margin (Interest rate = Wibor Central Bank Rate + Margin) is defined by your credit rating. Again, the Banks have said that accepting the offer of a repayment holiday will not affect your credit rating. Be aware that the onus is on you to make sure it doesn't. Look for details on this in the terms of each individual Bank offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the pandemic grows and eventually shrinks, we will try to keep you informed of the financial issues you need to know about. Let's keep in touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay safe,&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Coronavirus, The Polish Economy &amp; More</title>
			<link>https://blog.bigdoor24.pl/posts/2020-03-10-coronavirus-the-polish-economy-more.html</link>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Where do we come from? What are we? Where are we going?&amp;quot; by Paul Gauguin (Image)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's going on?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin, we have absolutely no idea what is going to happen to either the Polish property market nor to the Polish economy as a whole in the next 3 months. But at the heart of understanding the future, or at least trying to, is to understand what exactly is happening now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday (March 9th), world stock markets, including the Warsaw Exchange, opened and immediately fell in value by levels not seen since the depression of 2008. The immediate headlines  suggested that coronavirus is behind this collapse but this would be to ignore the underlying problems that were built into world growth beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 10 years of growth many experts expected a correction or even a recession in 2020, although nothing to compare to 2008. There is no doubt that a spreading Coronavirus was an accelerator to slowing growth but the key to the recent market fall is too high levels of debt and the Russian/Saudi Oil war on the American Shale Oil industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before all of this, we were preparing an article on how property is an excellent way of guarding yourself against increasing inflation. There is no doubt that inflation was the biggest danger to the Polish Economy. The Central Bank were expected to raise Interest rates in their last meeting to try to manage this inflation spiral, as is their job. They didn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, they have amended their inflation update for 2020 from 2.8 to 3.7 % but reduced their GDP forecast. So inflation is still an issue and slowing growth is expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reduction in oil prices and the shock to the world economy, which is essentially a demand &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; supply problem, normally it's one or the other, would suggest that inflation and growth forecasts at the moment will be a moving number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continue to believe, based on existing data, that Poland will repeat it's trick of 10 years ago and not be affected by this economic slowdown as much as other countries as debt levels still remain comparatively low. It will be affected As economic activity decreases a lot of businesses and property developers will be squeezed resulting in  opportunities for those investors who like risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;When there is fear, get greedy, when there is greed, be fearful&amp;quot; - Warren Buffet, 1986&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Zloty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expect the Zloty to lose value in the coming period as investors move to safe haven currencies like the Euro, US Dollar and the Swiss Franc. The Central Bank does a pretty good job of keeping the currency stable but they may let it drift a bit to help with exports. We would see it going from the current 4.32 to the next level of 4.41 and possibly beyond in the coming days/weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would not suggest that anyone tries to gamble on when we get back to &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot;, but there will be an end to the current turmoil. If you were planning to invest in Polish property this year, you should be prepared to move fast to catch a bargain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a preparatory checklist, do an inventory of your financial strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- How much cash on hand have you got?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- How much are you able to borrow if you do decide to buy a property? (&lt;a href="https://blog.bigdoor24.pl/posts/2018-06-15-getting-a-home-loan.html"&gt;see our article on Polish Mortgages&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- If you only consider investments for the longer term (5 year+), how will this impact you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stay up to date with economic commentary and consider questions like -&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Will reduced tourism affect Krakow rents?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Will increased working from home raise the price of Warsaw suburban apartments in the long term?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Will this affect the size of the apartments that are most in demand?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- We will have an extended time of low interest rates but when will they go up and can you cover that increase?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will continue to write more articles, and in more detail, as new events occur so let's keep in touch.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Have you got a Swiss Franc Polish Mortgage? Don't get cheated again!</title>
			<link>https://blog.bigdoor24.pl/posts/2020-02-28-have-you-got-a-swiss-franc-polish-mortgage-dont-get-fleeced-again.html</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In October of last year, a test case was successfully brought in the European Court by a Polish couple against their Bank over the terms of their Swiss Franc Mortgage. A complicated judgement that essentially denied the banks claim they they alone had the right to set the exchange rates when demanding repayments. This has resulted in a flood of similar claims from all over the country as homeowners received confirmation of what they had always suspected, the Banks were screwing them and they were due recompense.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In October of last year, a test case was successfully brought in the European Court by a Polish couple against their Bank over the terms of their Swiss Franc Mortgage. A complicated judgement that essentially denied the banks claim they they alone had the right to set the exchange rates when demanding repayments. This has resulted in a flood of similar claims from all over the country as homeowners received confirmation of what they had always suspected, the Banks were screwing them and they were due recompense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on BigDoor24 research, we think someone else is now trying to screw them, and all in the open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The property business, like lots of others, are built on the notion of ignorance. In the same way that if you are a Circus Clown you are unlikely to understand the work of a Doctor, or vice versa, Lawyers are betting you wont understand their work either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen lots of legal groups setting up a cottage industry modelling themselves on the American system of class action suits, offering homeowners the possibility of reimbursement for the small price of an initial zl. 2,000 - 5,000 plus 20 or 30% of the final payout. These legal eagles will do all of the paperwork and judicial submissions and all you have to do is wait for your cheque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a bad offer, until you realise that there is in effect, no legal argument to be made. &lt;strong&gt;The legal judgement has already been decided.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you need is a lawyer who has reviewed the judgement to decide whether you qualify for a refund or not. Assuming you do, then the lawyer simply enters the claim to the court and sits back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may of course be complications and nuances to your particular contract that will require some extra legal work but ....and here is where BigDoor24 weighs in ...not 30% of the award worth! Yes there is work to be done and yes there are court fees to be paid but .....&lt;/p&gt;

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Despite, in some cases, double digit growth in property prices in Poland in the last year, we examine whether renting or buying is a better option for your finances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using information compiled from recent articles by &lt;a href="https://www.expander.pl/raport-expandera-i-rentier-io-najem-mieszkan-iv-kw-2019/"&gt;expander/rentier.io&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.money.pl/gospodarka/ceny-mieszkan-w-polsce-rosna-lata-wyrzeczen-i-srednia-pensja-to-za-malo-6476836634400897a.html"&gt;money.pl&lt;/a&gt; we have compiled some graphs that may help in your decision to buy a Polish property and/or get a Polish mortgage in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin we look at apartment growth by City during 2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../assets/Images/2019-Apartment-price-by-city-graph.png" class="img-fluid img-responsive" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there has been growth, but should we rent or buy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, we can look at the cost of renting 3 types of apartments in major Polish cities. Making a comparison of net rent ( without ancillary costs i.e. management fee, tax etc ) versus the cost of borrowing 90 % to purchase a similar property, again without any extra expenses like insurance etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have displayed the results as a percentage of savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for example, Warsaw has an average rent that is 22% higher than the cost of a monthly mortgage payment. In numerical terms, the average rent for a 35m2 apartment is zl. 2,425 and a monthly mortgage payment for a similar apartment would be zl. 1982 making a saving of zl 443. Therefore  renting is 22 % more expensive than buying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="m2-apartment"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;35 m2 Apartment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../assets/Images/35sqm-rent-v-mortgage-graph.png" class="img-fluid img-responsive" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="m2-apartment-1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;50 m2 Apartment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../assets/Images/50m2-rent-v-mortgage.png" class="img-fluid img-responsive" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://bigdoor24.pl/"&gt;Did you know? BigDoor24.pl pays you zl. 200 per zl. 100,000 borrowed when you find a Polish Mortgage Advisor through BigDoor24.pl. (With zl. 250 for a successful Applicant referral - register for your personal referral code)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="m2-apartment-2"&gt;70 m2 Apartment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../assets/Images/70m2-rent-v-mortgage.png" class="img-fluid img-responsive" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see a striking difference between the smaller and larger apartments which might suggest that if you are considering buying an apartment for investment it may be better to buy two smaller ones rather than one larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above figures come from a recent report from Expander/ Rentior.io and covers data from the period October 1 2019 to 31 December 2019. Whilst BigDoor24 may disagree slightly with some of the averages, we feel the differences aren't enough to fundamentally change the basic message of the data.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Polish Property Market 2020 - A Good Time to Buy?</title>
			<link>https://blog.bigdoor24.pl/posts/2020-01-28-polish-property-market-2020-a-good-time-to-buy.html</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;What a year it's been for both the Polish economy generally and the Polish property market in particular. Growth in the number of new build properties, prices and mortgage approvals all exceeded official forecasts. Unemployment, despite increasing marginally in the last quarter remains at an historic low of 5.1 % and salaries have increased on average by 6% in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;What a year it's been for both the Polish economy generally and the Polish property market in particular. Growth in the number of new build properties, prices and mortgage approvals all exceeded official forecasts. Unemployment, despite increasing marginally in the last quarter remains at an historic low of 5.1 % and salaries have increased on average by 6% in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So where do we go from here?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly it should be said, forecasting is a mugs game in a world as interconnected as ours when a sneeze in China can impact the stock price of an engineering firm in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, we can look at the progression of the Polish economy and suggest that all signs at the moment suggest a slight slowdown this year but a continuance of growth for the foreseeable future. We would be less positive of the level of economic growth this year than many experts (&lt;a href="https://www.thefirstnews.com/article/ring-in-the-new-polands-economy-set-to-keep-growing-in-2020-despite-problems-next-door-9526"&gt;see TheFirstNews article on the Polish economy 2020 here&lt;/a&gt;) but only because of external international events.(U.S. Election, Brexit, Chinese slowdown, Climate costs etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about property?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020, property prices will go up. There, we said it. Not a very bold statement considering all of the data but a statement all the same. How much it will go up will depend on a lot of factors but up it will go. It will not go up much more that the actual entrance and exit costs of a property transaction though. If you are considering investing in Polish Property this year, it should be considered a long term investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why will Polish property continue to rise?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://bigdoor24.pl/"&gt;Did you know? BigDoor24.pl pays you zl. 200 per zl. 100,000 borrowed when you find a Polish Mortgage Advisor through BigDoor24.pl. (With zl. 250 for a successful Applicant referral - register for your personal referral code)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Land&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the short term, developers are reporting a shortage of suitable available land for development in all major cities. This will obviously reduce supply and with demand expected to remain steady or increase, prices will have to reflect the scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interest Rates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest rates are at an historic low of 1.5% and despite jumps in inflation, most analysts do not expect the Central bank to begin raising rates anytime soon. A long term investor should include a rise of mortgage costs in their calculation but also consider an expected rise in rental income that would come hand in hand with inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Minimum Wage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government recently announced a plan to double the minimum wage by 2024( &lt;a href="https://blog.bigdoor24.pl/posts/2019-09-11-how-will-doubling-the-minimum-wage-affect-polish-property.html"&gt;see BigDoor24 article on it's effects here&lt;/a&gt;). It suggests the government has made a decision that Poland will not be a low cost economy in the future but will attempt to attract higher paying industries much like Ireland has done by attracting Facebook, Apple and more to locate and hire there. Any increase in salaries will likely translate to an increase in property prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low Unemployment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employment stands at an historically low 5.1%. An economist will tell you that anything below 5 % is essentially zero unemployment. This is not always a good thing as it can put a real strain on growth if there not enough workers available for new businesses. However, as the government has issued a record number of work permits, outstripping Germany, we would consider this a good problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polish Mortgage Growth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poland has a much lower level of mortgages than the EU average and the ratio of house prices to disposable income is again quite low by European standards (source Hypostat). This will change as mortgages become more accessible and attractive, resulting in higher prices in the longer term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salaries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a shortage of workers comes a demand for higher wages. Coupled with the minimum wage hike plan we expect this to continue. Long term shortages will not be good but as already mentioned, we are not there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brexit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to say. There are many reports of Polish nationals currently based in the UK making plans to return home as the Polish economy grows and the UK one ....shrinks? This will obviously increase demand but by how much it is hard to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So overall we remain confident that the future looks bright for Polish property investment. In terms of what to buy and where, The &lt;a href="https://blog.bigdoor24.pl/tags/investment"&gt;BigDoor24 Blog&lt;/a&gt; has lots of articles that may help. Please do plenty of research before buying and remember, the above represents our best opinions, not our promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Hunting.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Buying for Investment? Should you Bother Renting it Out?</title>
			<link>https://blog.bigdoor24.pl/posts/2020-01-21-buying-for-investment-should-you-bother-renting.html</link>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Buying an apartment anywhere in the world can be like booking a Ryanair flight. The headline price rarely is what it actually costs you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When buying a new apartment in Poland it is usually delivered to you in what is called Developers standard. This requires you to fit out the property with floors, kitchens , bathrooms etc. Apart from the time it takes and the difficulty in actually getting qualified workers to do it, it costs money. Lots of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A normal investor has a three word plan when they decide to take the plunge - Buy, Rent &amp;amp; Sell. in this article we are going to explore the idea of NOT renting and how this may affect your returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our example we will make things simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have Zl. 600,000 cash. You buy a 60 sqm new apartment for 480,000 (zl. 8,000 per SQM), leaving you with zl. 120,000 and a shell apartment. You spend the remaining zl. 120,000 fitting out the apartment and preparing it for rent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on averages you can be expected to rent it our for about zl. 50 per sqm per month netting you zl. 3,000 per month or zl. 36,000 per year. Over a 5 year period, and assuming it takes 6 months to prepare the property for rent and allowing for slight delays in tenant turnover you will have earned 162,000.(36k x 4.5years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's also assume that your property value has gone up by 20 % in the intervening years, and is now worth 60 sqm x 9,600 = zl. 576,000. Assuming some of your furniture, fixtures and fittings are nearing the end of their shelf life we will add zl. 50,000 to this price to reflect the fact that it is not a developer standard apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So your gross profit after 5 years will be 626,000 less your zl. 600,000 investment = zl. 26,000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would expect that a portion of this profit will have been eaten up in rental commissions, accountants and tax so after 5 years and a 20 % gain you are left with ... pretty much what you invested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if you hadn't fitted out the property? What if you had bought more square metres?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't rent out your property and leave it empty your only real recurring cost will be your building administration fee. These can vary wildly and are usually added to the rent you charge your tenant so if you don't have a tenant you will need to pay this fee yourself. Lets assume its zl. 7 per sqm. per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to the original scenario, how about you buy 70 sqm instead of 60 sqm. This will cost you zl. 560,000. The administration fee will come in at zl. 29,400 for the 5 years so your total expense will be zl. 589,400.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://bigdoor24.pl/"&gt;Did you know? - BigDoor24.pl actually pays you CashBack when you find and use a Credit Advisor through our free service.  More Details here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's shoot ahead to 5 years with the 20% value increase. Your 70 sqm are now worth zl. 672,000 (70 x 9.6k) netting you a profit of zl. 82,600 with no deductions for commissions, bookkeeping etc., plus of course the zl. 10,600 you didn't spend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all of course average numbers and there is no guarantee the property will go up but it's certainly worth looking at when deciding how to buy your next investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would add that it is an all cash purchase. If you are using a mortgage to finance the purchase then the numbers obviously change along with your monthly cash requirements. And if we had zl. 600,000 we would buy three apartments and put a mortgage on each! .. but that's just us:-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Hunting,&lt;/p&gt;

			<guid>https://blog.bigdoor24.pl/posts/2019-12-02-which-polish-city-offers-best-value-for-property-investment.html</guid>
			<pubDate>Mon, 02 Dec 2019 10:07:09 GMT</pubDate>
			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you in the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; City?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When deciding where to buy (or indeed if to sell) a property there are many ways to indicate where prices are heading and indeed the best city to find value in. For this article, we are going to look at salaries vs. price.  Whilst we would never suggest you look at only one statistic when deciding where to invest we believe it is a good starting point when looking for value in the Polish property market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First a couple of basic facts. Currently a Polish mortgage will cost you zl. 400 per zl. 100,000 borrowed (approx.) and the Banks don't want you borrowing more than you can afford to repay each month. This therefore puts a ceiling on how much a local worker can pay for a square meter(M2) of property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CW Wealth Management recently reported in &lt;a href="https://ceoworld.biz/2019/07/29/where-polands-richest-live-the-top-10-wealthiest-cities/"&gt;CEO World Magazine&lt;/a&gt; a list of earnings per population for the main Polish cities. They have reported these numbers in USD and don't stipulate whether they are gross or net of taxes - We would think gross. Additionally, they do not explain their methodology however we shall assume that if there are mistakes they are consistent. We will use the USD/PLN rate of 3.85.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For property prices we have used the average price of 1 square meter as per the top three property portals in each city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/Images/salary-m2.jpg" class="img-fluid img-responsive" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially the chart shows what percentage of your monthly salary it would take to buy 1 sqm of a new apartment development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the chart we can see that while Rzeszow holds top spot Warsaw still, despite the higher relative prices, is worth looking at as an investment location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With demand continuing apace, salaries continuing to rise and the relatively low levels of mortgages in the polish property market it is possible that these percentages could move even further north in the future if we look at them in isolation. Of course there are many other factors that should be used to influence your decision and we will cover those in future articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And remember, if you do need polish mortgage advice, use BigDoor24 to find an advisor who speaks your language and we will pay you zl. 200 for every zl. 100,000 successfully borrowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Investing,&lt;/p&gt;

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Further to our initial articles in the series, &lt;a href="https://bigdoor24.pl/blog/posts/2019-10-17-are-property-agents-a-waste-of-money.html"&gt;Are Polish Property Agents a Waste of Money/ Selling&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://bigdoor24.pl/blog/posts/2019-11-05-are-polish-property-agents-a-waste-of-money.html"&gt;Buying&lt;/a&gt; we now look at Renting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent Bloomberg article claiming that &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-10-11/real-estate-agents-don-t-deserve-6"&gt;German and American property agents were ripping off their clients&lt;/a&gt; in high fees and low service we decided it was time to look at what Polish property Agents do, don't do and where does your commission go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin, fees in Poland are different from other countries and a basic rule of thumb is that buying or selling will cost you 3 % + VAT of the sale/purchase price whilst renting or letting will cost a months rent + VAT. These are headline costs and as we will explain, there is lots of room for negotiation. Additionally, being aware of these fees can be very important when deciding to sell or let as your buyer or renter will certainly include this information in their decision making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would add another feature of the process is that any agent you contract to help can do a deal on your behalf with another agency agent and in most cases they just split the total commission when a deal is completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the third of our series we will look at&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Renting a Property&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first issue is where are the properties advertised. See our previous article series on &lt;a href="https://bigdoor24.pl/blog/posts/2019-06-07-best-property-portals-in-poland-ranked.html"&gt;the best property online portals in Poland&lt;/a&gt; for more details on where to look. This article is concerned with what to look for and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the options?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When renting a property in a new city or one that you are not totally familiar with it can be both daunting and intimidating.  You want to find a place that is safe and convenient and not get ripped off in the process with excessive fees or indeed the rent level itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Direct Approach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can look at the offers on the property portals that are direct and do not include any agency mediation. In many cases, dealing with the landlord directly can be perfectly safe and effective but as with life, there are no guarantees. If you have a Polish friend then we would suggest that this is the way to go as they will be able to provide you with both local information and language assistance. The only real downside to this approach is that the majority of properties are not offered directly so you may be limiting your choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using an Agent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do decide to use a Polish property agent then essentially you are hiring a friend with benefits. Assuming you use BigDoor24.pl to find an agent that speaks your language, removing this barrier as an issue, you can then get a the help of a professional who has access to all the landlords in the city and provide you with proper advice on the location and type of apartment that suits your needs and budget. They will also be responsible for the rental contract and you can query any part you want reassurance on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agents should also be helpful in just advising you about the general requirements (where to buy a kettle, tram etc ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no obstacle to speaking with lots of agents and settling on the one who best suits your needs i.e. honest, hard working and LISTENS (not all do!) to your requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you negotiate the fee?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is more demand these days for properties to rent than there are properties available so you are not in the strongest position. However, depending on your budget, you should definitely try to negotiate. Agents referred to you by BigDoor24 already have to give you a 25 % discount but if you are renting something for zl. 5000 per month you may be able to get more off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, be aware that if the property is exclusive to the agent then it is likely they are already being paid by the landlord. This may give you more room to negotiate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is best to negotiate when you have chosen a property rather than at the first meeting as a too early agreement may actually work against you. (i.e. The Agent doesn't bother working too hard for a lower commission).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Rental Contract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please review the article &lt;a href="https://bigdoor24.pl/blog/posts/2019-02-16-polish-rental-agreement-5-things-you-need-to-know.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polish Rental Agreement - 5 things you need to know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for more information on what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of a property agent can be quite a subjective decision but hopefully the above will help you get the most from whatever decision you make. We have lots more articles in our &lt;a href="https://bigdoor24.pl/blog/"&gt;Blog section&lt;/a&gt; that may also help in your adventure or just &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/bigdoor24/"&gt;like us now&lt;/a&gt; on FB to stay up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Renting,&lt;/p&gt;

			<pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2019 11:30:29 GMT</pubDate>
			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Whether buying or selling, it's a good idea (and required if getting a Polish mortgage) to get a good independent valuation. And strangely, not all valuers are created equally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are Selling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst you don't &amp;quot;need&amp;quot; a valuation, it can be difficult to decide on the optimum price to sell for. Your agent will advise a price that they believe will get you to offer the property exclusively through them. This is their first goal and they know they can change the price later.( We note the better agents realise this is self defeating and should be more market based in their appraisal)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at other nearby properties for sale on a search engine may help for standard apartments but for houses with gardens etc  it may be harder to judge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another advantage to getting a valuation is that it can help with negotiations. The banks take the valuation to calculate the home loan so a buyer cannot negotiate too far away from the price by claiming that they only have X to pay etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ensure that the valuer that you hire is accepted by ALL banks you may be able to sell the valuation report to the eventual buyer to use when applying for their home loan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are Buying&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are getting a Polish mortgage then you will definitely need a valuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first rule is that you should get a valuer that is accepted by all banks. Some valuers are only accepted by some banks and not others despite having the same qualifications. Your application for a home loan will probably go to more than one bank so this is very very important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unlikely that you will get a valuation on every house you view but knowing how much you can borrow will be determined by this report so it's a little bit chicken and egg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are unhappy with the valuation feel free to argue. The reports are pretty detailed but there may be some overlooked aspects that you can point out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bigdoor24.pl/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you know ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bigdoor24.pl/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BigDoor24.pl sends you a zl. 250 retail voucher of your choice for every successful Polish Mortgage Applicant referred - (in addition to what we send them) - register now for your personal referral code.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costs of valuations can vary wildly depending on the property etc so it is worth shopping around. Obviously the ones that are accepted by all banks are more expensive but at the same time, may save you money down the line. A good indication is anywhere between Zl. 500 and Zl. 1,000 depending on size etc..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where to find them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best place is through your Polish Mortgage Advisor rather than a real estate agent. The valuation is to get a mortgage and the mortgage adviser wants you to get one so they should recommend the most suitable professional for your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't forget that through a BigDoor24.pl referred Polish Mortgage Advisor you will receive cash back which could cover the costs of any valuation professional you hire. &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/bigdoor24/"&gt;Like us on Facebook for regular helpful articles on living &amp;amp; working in Poland.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;If you are in Poland for the weekend it is unlikely you will spend enough to make any real difference to how you buy your Zloty but for anyone staying a little longer, it's worth figuring out the most efficient way of changing your currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;It's all about the spread&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spread is the difference between what Zloty sells and buys for. For example - EUR/ PLN 4.20 - 4.30 means that the exchange will sell you 4.20 PLN for every 1 Euro and buy your PLN for 1 Euro for every PLN 4.30 exchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind then you don't actually have to know what the current exchange rate is or even the price in another location. The smaller the spread, the difference between the two prices, is the best indication of getting best value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is for this reason that it is safe to say that you should never exchange money in any high street bank&lt;/em&gt;. In many instances you will find that, using the above example, their price could be something like 3.90 - 4.70. This is the financial equivalent of punching you in the face when you step inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bigdoor24.pl/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you know ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bigdoor24.pl/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BigDoor24.pl sends you a zl. 250 retail voucher of your choice for every successful Polish Mortgage Applicant referred - (in addition to what we send them) - register now for your personal referral code.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kantor - FX Money Exchange Store&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kantors are littered throughout all Polish cities and they are by far and away the best place to exchange your cash. You should expect a price of 4.25 - 4.30, again using the above example, and sometimes as good as 4.27 - 4.29.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**&lt;em&gt;Online&lt;/em&gt; **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you want to transfer money from home it may be best to use one of the dedicated FX platforms like &lt;a href="https://www.rkantor.com/"&gt;RKantor.com&lt;/a&gt; which tends to be quite competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cards&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using cards like &lt;a href="https://www.revolut.com/en-PL?p=branded_campaign&amp;amp;ext=&amp;amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIieaWkb3p5QIVxpQYCh3hUgA9EAAYASAAEgJRaPD_BwE"&gt;Revolut&lt;/a&gt;  or &lt;a href="https://n26.com/en-eu/euro-bank-account?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=br&amp;amp;utm_campaign=1617329946&amp;amp;utm_content=62689487418&amp;amp;utm_term=n26&amp;amp;matchtype=e&amp;amp;device=c&amp;amp;loc_physical_ms=9067602&amp;amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI9bT-gb7p5QIVBqqaCh0CgwM0EAAYASAAEgJ1m_D_BwE"&gt;N26&lt;/a&gt; claim to take away a lot of the hassle with good value currency transfers built in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask a local&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because many Poles have their home loans in non-Zloty currencies they are very aware of the best places to exchange their money. It may be best to ask them which particular local Kantors or online services tend to consistently give the best rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polish Zloty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a well managed and fairly stable currency so you shouldn't expect any large swings. The best advice might be to just change your money when you need to rather than waiting for a better price unless you require a substantial amount changed. If you do require a larger amount changed or you are planning a Polish Mortgage in a currency other than Zloty, speak to your bank (make sure they are giving you a good rate, not always applicable) or use an online service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ATM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you are desperate but really .. just don't. The rate of exchange, particularly at the Euro ATM's, are close to criminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Hunting !&lt;/p&gt;
